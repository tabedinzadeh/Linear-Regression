In this project we have data related to the appearance and technical characteristics of the car, based on which we want to check the effect of the variable width of the car on its weight. The name of our data is " automobile ". This analysis is based on simple linear regression.
The program code is implemented in Python and its name is

 ## "linearRegression.py"


By running the program, we find that there is a strong linear relationship between the width of the car and its weight because the value of r2 is equal to 0.78.
